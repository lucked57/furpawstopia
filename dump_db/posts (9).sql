(80, 59, 'About the Breed', 'The Golden Retriever, an exuberant Scottish gundog of great beauty, stands among America\'s most popular dog breeds. They are serious workers at hunting and field work, as guides for the blind, and in search-and-rescue, enjoy obedience and other competitive events, and have an endearing love of life when not at work. The Golden Retriever is a sturdy, muscular dog of medium size, famous for the dense, lustrous coat of gold that gives the breed its name. The broad head, with its friendly and intelligent eyes, short ears, and straight muzzle, is a breed hallmark. In motion, Goldens move with a smooth, powerful gait, and the feathery tail is carried, as breed fanciers say, with a \'merry action.\' The most complete records of the development of the Golden Retriever are included in the record books that were kept from 1835 until about 1890 by the gamekeepers at the Guisachan (pronounced Gooeesicun) estate of Lord Tweedmouth at Inverness-Shire, Scotland. These records were released to public notice in Country Life in 1952, when Lord Tweedmouth\'s great-nephew, the sixth Earl of Ilchester, historian and sportsman, published material that had been left by his ancestor. They provided factual confirmation to the stories that had been handed down through generations. Goldens are outgoing, trustworthy, and eager-to-please family dogs, and relatively easy to train. They take a joyous and playful approach to life and maintain this puppyish behavior into adulthood. These energetic, powerful gundogs enjoy outdoor play. For a breed built to retrieve waterfowl for hours on end, swimming and fetching are natural pastimes.', 'web/img/post/67cac19a72302.jpeg', '2025-03-07', 'mikedog', '', 'This is my profile', '', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', ''),

Persian kitties do well with mild-mannered children and laid-back dogs.\r\n\r\nCharacteristics\r\nThe Persian kitty has some distinct features, including a round head with a short face and snub nose. She also has chubby cheeks, big, round eyes and small, rounded ears. Persians have short, strong legs to support their sturdy bodies.\r\n\r\nLifespan\r\n15 to 20 years\r\n\r\nColors\r\nThe original Persian Cat had shiny, gray fur. Due to selective breeding, however, they now boast an array of different colors. In fact, there are 7 different coat color divisions total for competition purposes.\r\n\r\nThese range from silver and gold to white, smoky and solid-colored. Their eye color corresponds to their coat color. For example, white Persians tend to have deep blue or copper eyes, whereas silver or golden Persians have green eyes and solid-colored cats have copper eyes.\r\n\r\nShedding\r\nAlthough they can shed a lot, proper grooming will prevent your Persian kitty from leaving hair all over your home. Comb her hair daily to prevent tangles and matting and to remove loose hair.

(85, 60, 'About turtle', 'turtle, (order Testudines), any reptile with a body encased in a bony shell, including tortoises. Although numerous animals, from invertebrates to mammals, have evolved shells, none has an architecture like that of turtles. The turtle shell has a top (carapace) and a bottom (plastron). The carapace and plastron are bony structures that usually join one another along each side of the body, creating a rigid skeletal box. This box, composed of bone and cartilage, is retained throughout the turtle’s life. Because the shell is an integral part of the body, the turtle cannot exit it, nor is the shell shed like the skin of some other reptiles.\r\n\r\nThere are approximately 356 species of turtles living on land in all continents except Antarctica and in both salt water and fresh water. Tortoises (family Testudinidae) live exclusively on land and have anatomic features distinguishing them from other turtles, but the term tortoise has long been used to refer to other terrestrial testudines as well, such as the box turtle and the wood turtle. Similarly, terrapin was sometimes used to describe any aquatic turtle but is now largely restricted to the edible diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) of the eastern United States.', 'web/img/post/67cd25b4006b0.jpg', '2025-03-09', 'Emily_turtle', 'web/img/Proflie/67cd257e6ab43.jpeg', 'Turtle lover', '', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', ''),
(86, 57, 'British Shorthair about', 'Devotees of this robust, powerful breed often liken it to a teddy bear. Cuddly and comforting, the calm presence of a British Shorthair in the home means a welcoming “smile” for visitors and loyal, affectionate companionship for everyone in the house—mice, of course, excepted! This cat’s short, dense coat contains more hairs per square inch than any other breed, making it luxuriously rich to the touch yet easy to care for. With their sturdy, muscular builds, they are most comfortable keeping all four feet on the floor, so are highly unlikely to invade kitchen counters or endanger your good china.\r\n\r\nConsidered the modern embodiment of ancient Roman cats, British Shorthairs first came into the public eye at turn-of-the century cat shows in London’s Crystal Palace. Both World Wars wreaked havoc on the gene pool and necessitated some cross-breeding to both Persians and “moggies” (random-bred domestic shorthairs) in order to maintain and then improve the type. By the 1950s, British breeders’ efforts had become so successful that a blue male named Brynbuboo Little Monarch was the very first Grand Champion of any breed in the U.K.’s Governing Council of the Cat Fancy. Monarch was such a popular stud that most Brits today trace their ancestry back to him. First exported to the U.S. in the early 1900s, these cats were initially registered as “British Blues,” but are now seen in many colors, including other solids, bicolors, and tabbies.', 'web/img/post/67cd26c1c9301.jpg', '2025-03-09', 'tali_dog', 'web/img/Proflie/65ae01ecb48e0.jpeg', 'This is my profile', '', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', ''),

There are many reasons why German Shepherds stand in the front rank of canine royalty, but experts say their defining attribute is character: loyalty, courage, confidence, the ability to learn commands for many tasks, and the willingness to put their life on the line in defense of loved ones.

(95, 60, 'A Beginner’s Guide to Keeping Turtles', 'With their stunning patterns, large eyes and little feet, plus their slow movements, lovable personalities and incredible longevity, it’s easy to see why turtles make fascinating pets. But what’s the best way to care for them? We spoke with veterinary experts about every aspect of basic pet turtle care, from diet and habitat to what to do when they’re sick.\r\n\r\nMany pet turtles live a very long life. Some tortoises have lived to over 100 years old!\r\nTurtles have a good sense of hearing and are able to recognize their keepers.\r\nTurtles can see in color and prefer to eat colorful food items.\r\nTurtles in cold places can slow their heart and metabolism down during the winter. This decreases their need for oxygen, so they can spend the entire winter living beneath the ice of a pond.\r\nThe easiest way to tell the difference between a turtle and a tortoise is that turtles are water-dwelling creatures with webbed feet or flippers, and tortoises are land-dwelling creatures with more elephantlike feet. Most turtles are more omnivorous (feeding on both plant and animal sources), while generally all tortoises are herbivorous (eating plant sources only).\r\n\r\nA turtle’s habitat requirements vary depending on their species. Price Dickson, DVM, a veterinarian specializing in birds and reptiles at My Pet’s Animal Hospital in Lakeland, Florida, provides an overall guideline for slider turtles (e.g., species like red-eared slider turtles and yellow-bellied sliders), who get their name from the way they slide into the water to escape predators. She adds that most aquatic and semi-aquatic turtles also do well with these guidelines.\r\n\r\nThe type of bedding or substrate you choose to get for your pet turtle will depend on how you’d like to set up their tank.\r\n\r\n“The easiest is a large stone or gravel that is too large to fit in the turtle’s mouth,” Dr. Dickson says. Size matters here, because turtles may try to swallow their bedding, which can lead to medical problems. Using stones that your turtle literally can’t ingest eliminates that risk.', 'web/img/post/67cd2c11df388.jpg', '2025-03-09', 'Emily_turtle', 'web/img/Proflie/67cd257e6ab43.jpeg', 'Turtle lover', '', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', ''),
(97, 61, 'All British Shorthair tips you will ever need', 'British Shorthair kittens can be demanding. They are super active, so you will have to dedicate some time and patience to teach them proper manners and good behaviour. Your kitty will calm down once they go through their kittenhood and adolescence, but you can expect a bumpy ride in the beginning. It\'s a common opinion that humans establish stronger bonds with baby cats, which is not untrue, but it’s hardly a rule. If you decide that a kitten is too much for you, you can easily go for a mature cat. A grown British Shorthair can be a fantastic companion minus all the challenges that raising a kitten brings. Once you have decided whether you want a kitten or an adult, you should determine if you prefer a boy or a girl. Some people may advise getting a female British Shorthair to avoid potential aggression and destructiveness, but there is no need to worry about it with this breed. Male or female, British Shorthairs exhibit no aggressive or destructive tendencies, and they do OK when left alone. The only aspect where females get an extra point is health. Although a generally healthy breed, British Shorthair toms are prone to more hereditary diseases than queens (heart problems mainly). The only actual difference is in size because boys tend to grow bigger than girls. Still, gender shouldn\'t play a crucial role in this decision because all British Shorthairs are affectionate and loyal. When you welcome a cat into your home, you must make them feel comfortable and accepted. Your British Shorthair needs: Litter box—Nothing about a British Shorthair is small, so you need to get a large litter box. Ideally, the tray should be as wide as your grown British Shorthair is long and 50% longer than your cat. You should also preferably have two litter boxes for one cat in your home Food and water dishes—It would be best to opt for ceramic or stainless steel instead of plastic dishes. Cats can easily scratch or nick plastic, creating a convenient breeding ground for bacteria, viruses, and mould. As for water, a fountain may be a better option as most felines prefer running water. Hydration is crucial to avoid UTIs, kidney disease, bladder stones, and similar issues Bed—Although your kitty will probably nap wherever they want, you should still get a cosy bed for them. Go for something with washable covers—it should be big enough to accommodate a fully grown British Shorthair Cat carrier—When picking a suitable carrier, consider the weight and size it can support. A British Shorthair can weigh up to 8 kg and be up to 46 cm high and 64 cm long Scratching post—Cats must scratch to trim and file their nails and stretch their bodies. Scratching is also crucial for claw, joint, and muscle health. If they don\'t have a dedicated place to do it, they will find the next best thing, i.e. your furniture.

A great Dane and a Pekinese are both classified as dogs; the ideal home for one wouldn’t suit the other. It is no different for parrots. Best first time parrot\r\nThe obvious choice is the budgerigar or the cockatiel. These are ideal if cost is a factor, as smaller birds require less money to acquire and set up.\r\n\r\nThat said any pet bird, who isn’t trained to step up out of the cage and go back into the cage won’t be an agreeable pet. If you don’t have time to interact with the parrot and allow out of cage time, then a parrot is not the best pet for you.\r\n\r\nThe best bird for you also depends on how much time you have to devote to the bird and how much your’re willing to learn about parrots in general, and your preferred species.\r\n\r\n\r\nBudgerigars as pets\r\nThese birds make a good first time pet, and many devoted parrot people will tell you that their first bird was a budgie (Melopsittacus undulatus).\r\n\r\nAlong with the canary, and the cockatiel, these three species have been domesticated for much longer than other species.\r\n\r\nBudgerigars were first bred in USA in the 1850’s. They are small birds weighing 30-40 grams, averaging 18 cm in length.\r\n\r\nThey are easy to find and inexpensive and do not need a large cage. Most budgies and canaries are still fed on bird seed rather than pellets and they can be picky eaters.\r\n\r\nMy daughter-in-law’s budgie, Pimby, won’t try a new food unless she eats it first in front of him.\r\n\r\nIn the wild budgerigars eat a variety of seeds (grass seeds), fruits, berries and vegetation. In captivity they are playful and curious and if tamed young, make delightful pets. They are neither destructive nor noisy.\r\n\r\nThey are not long lived and rarely reach two figures which can be tragic for child owners. Like their larger cousins the Australian Galahs, care needs to be taken that their fat intake is monitored; they can be prone to lipomas and tumours.\r\n\r\nA tame budgie will often talk as well as sing and their voice is high and piping. The lone bird will sing continually to her reflection in the cage mirror.\r\n\r\nOne view about parrots (which is also mine) is that all species do better with a companion either of the same or opposite sex or even a compatible species. To the owner who complains ‘then my parrot won’t be so affectionate to me, will he?’ I‘d answer that “the added enjoyment you’ll get of watching the birds interact with each other is adequate compensation”.', 'web/img/post/67cd2e9a45632.webp', '2025-03-09', 'Harry_bird', 'web/img/Proflie/67cd2e5e6acb9.jpeg', 'My vlog about birds', '', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', ''),

Don’t forget to brush their teeth daily with dog toothpaste. Their nails should be trimmed as necessary, which could be anywhere from one to two times every month. Check the ears weekly to ensure there’s no dirt and to be aware of possible infections early enough. Exercise\r\n\r\nMalamutes have a history of hard work and amazing endurance. As such, they remain highly active even in other climates and require lots of activity. Take your malamute for regular walks and allow them to play and run freely outside. If you’re into hiking, skiing, skateboarding, or biking, malamutes may be the ideal pet for you.', 'web/img/post/67cd2f2a7f76e.jpeg', '2025-03-09', 'tali_dog', 'web/img/Proflie/65ae01ecb48e0.jpeg', 'This is my profile', '', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', ''),
(100, 57, 'Is the Golden Retriever a Good Fit for You?', 'Choosing the right pet for your family can be a difficult decision. There are so many options to choose from, and you may be considering one of America’s most popular dog breeds. The Golden Retriever is a loyal, outgoing and energetic dog that’s easy to train and maintains their playful, puppyish demeanor into adulthood. A beloved and timeless breed, the Golden Retriever has appeared in iconic movies and TV shows like “Full House,” “The Parent Trap,” and the “Air Bud” movies. Here are some things to consider about the breed if you’re thinking of adding them to your family.\r\n\r\nThe Golden Retriever’s Temperament\r\nA member of the Sporting Group, the Golden Retriever is a joyful, loyal companion that loves outdoor play. Goldens are excellent work dogs, with service inherent to their nature. Their obedience and skill is displayed through hunting, fieldwork, search-and rescue-operations, and working as service animals. The intelligent, devoted breed brings the same zeal for life outside of work too.\r\n\r\nThe Golden Retriever’s friendly and affectionate temperament make them an excellent pet and companion. They love to please their owners, making them a highly adaptable, trainable breed. Golden Retriever Physical Traits and Grooming Needs\r\nThe Golden Retriever is an iconic dog, known for their glossy, golden coat that gives the breed its name. Their short ears, friendly and intelligent eyes, broad head, and straight muzzle are considered a breed hallmark. They’re muscular, medium-sized dogs typically weighing between 55–75 pounds. Females are on the lower end, males are on the higher end. Golden Retrievers are 23–24 inches tall, with a lifespan of 10–12 years.\r\n\r\nGolden Retrievers have a medium length double coat. They heavily shed their thick, double coat once or twice a year, and shed moderately on a regular basis. Typically, Goldens should be brushed once or twice a week. During periods of heavy shedding, owners may look to incorporate daily brushing. Goldens don’t drool excessively. How Much Training Does a Golden Retriever Need?\r\nGolden Retrievers are eager to please their owners, which makes them an easier breed to train. Like any breed, early socialization and puppy training are important to a dog’s development. Early exposure to different types of people, environments, and situations will allow your new puppy to seamlessly transition into a well-behaved adult.\r\n\r\nAn active household would be the best fit for a Golden Retriever. Daily exercise plays a key role in your Golden’s development and demeanor. Golden Retrievers that don’t get enough exercise are prone to misbehaving, so ensure they get enough activity. They’re excellent companions on long runs, hikes, or bike rides. Plus, they love to swim and play fetch.', 'web/img/post/67cd2fa393135.jpeg', '2025-03-09', 'tali_dog', 'web/img/Proflie/65ae01ecb48e0.jpeg', 'This is my profile', '', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', ''),
